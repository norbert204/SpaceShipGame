Plan
- Entity Component System
    - Entity
        * Stored in LinkedList
        * Based on MegaStruct type
            - Transform
            - Sprite
            - Collider
    - Component
        * Every Component has an array of said components (so we have the advantage of speed of an ECS)
        * One element of the array links back to it's Entity (by ID mybe)
    - System
        * (yes..)
- Scenes
    - Scenes have a unique entity LinkedList

TODO
- Optimize the code because the FPS got hit HARD (reduce the number of loops maybe?)
- Finish ECS
- There are a bunch of mallocs..but where are the frees?
- Sound system
- Clear up the render methods
- REFACTOR
    * mathe.h
    * structs.h
    * window.h
